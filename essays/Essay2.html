  <p>Upon viewing the required WOD assignments, I opted to layout the basics of what my code should contain, as well as any tags that I may forget to include within my file onto a note to be displayed on my screen. I found that doing so allowed me to determine what exactly I will be making and aids in improving my overall time for each WOD assignment. For BrowserHistory1, I noticed that I took much longer in accomplishing this task as I was continously trying to figure out which tags I should be using. I would catch myself testing which tags would work better for what I am trying to display on my browser. However, I was able to finish creating the entire body of the HTML file below 17 minutes. Upon completing BrowserHistory2, I found that I was able to finish the required actions much faster that the previous assignment. This may have been because the assigned tasks were done through CSS, which mainly involves customizing how the HTML file appears on our browser, rather than making the actual HTML file. However, upon comparing this assignment with the final WOD assignment, BrowserHistory3, I found the second assignment to be the easiest out of the three. BrowserHistory3 was a little more complicated as the code provided by the video only worked under a specific view option on our browser. I personally did not find the code provided in the video to be as efficent, so I took it upon myself to edit this according to how I felt would work the best. Rather than creating 3 tags under the “float” command, I opted to create a table for the columns instead. This allowed the text provided to adjust to fullscreen and through a minimized view as well. Ultimately, my experience as an Assistant to the Teaching Assistant for ICS 101 has definitely helped me through the completion of these assignments and played a factor into my overall time.</p>
