  <p>I have made significant progress in programming, especially in understanding functions and improving my ability to identify and rectify errors more efficiently. Additionally, I have enhanced the clarity and simplicity of my code, utilizing CSS to elevate both the visual appeal and functionality of my projects. However, there is still room for improvement, particularly in selecting the most suitable code for a given assignment, where I often struggle with deciding between using JavaScript, CSS, or HTML to execute a command.</p>

<p>The Workouts of the Day (WODs) have proven beneficial for honing my independent problem-solving skills, although the repetitive nature of these tasks may not fully prepare me for entirely new coding challenges. Labs have been instrumental in increasing my confidence and proficiency, yet I acknowledge a gap in my confidence levels between JavaScript and HTML/CSS, with the former requiring additional attention for improvement. Reflecting on Assignment 1, I have garnered invaluable insights that have left me feeling well-prepared for the upcoming challenges of Assignment 2. My deep dive into the code during Assignment 1 has significantly increased my understanding and readiness.</p>

<p>While the overall classroom experience has been positive, I recognize areas for improvement to further enrich my learning journey. Establishing a more open environment for code-related questions, refining the flow in comprehending code, and fostering more engaging in-class lab discussions would contribute significantly to an enhanced learning experience.</p>

<p>Among the all of the class resources, I find screencasts, one-on-one assistance, and labs to be particularly advantageous. These resources not only facilitate a deeper understanding of course materials but also serve as avenues for expressing creativity within the realm of my projects.</p>
