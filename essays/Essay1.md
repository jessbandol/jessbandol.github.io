Flying over 5,296 miles across the world, I am Jess Bandol, a Bachelor of Business Administration Candidate in Management Information Systems and International Business. I have been leaving away from my hometown for three years and counting. Over the course of my stay on the island of O’ahu, I have found interest in hiking, baking, creating jewelry, and more. Although entering the field of business may not have been my initial choice of study, I am glad to have pursued my current majors. 

Despite having a heavy inclination to the field of Humanities and Hospitality, I decided to pursue a more technological route in college. I find that certain skills in various industries could be learnt through experience itself. However, skills involving the evolution of technology and more computer information based studies require a stricter curriculum. I took it upon myself to hone hard skills in college and brace the rapid evolution of technology in today’s society. I believe that nay business could benefit from the countless innovations coming form this digital age.
