The [WOD](https://jessbandol.github.io/ITM352_repo/WODs/SmartPhoneProducts1_1_variables/SmartPhoneProducts1_1/products_display.html) that our class was assigned to recently, involved learning how to make use of both JavaScript and HTML integratedly. We were to tasked to understand how to make use of JavaScript codes within HTML by simply using specific tags and linking certain files within the repository. Although the WOD assignment was generally easy to accomplish, I found myself stuck whe inputting code from JavaScript onto the HTML. As we are so used to including lines of commands and functions that work within HTML, it is easy to forget that certain commands require extra steps to work as they may be from JavaScript. In order to prepare, I would review the video material provided beforehand and create a separate list of the given steps on laulima. This preparational process is no different than my usual routine when accomplishing other WOD assignments. For this WOD in particulary, I would suggest reading into the code that is being copy-pasted onto the file. This makes it easier to figure out why certain commands do not immediately work when saved.
