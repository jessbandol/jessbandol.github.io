To understand and get along with the people with whom we share our lives, it is important to trust, respect, and love each other. To communicate these feelings is the philosophy that guides Sanrio.

Since its founding in 1960, Sanrio has applied our philosophy to all that we do, including the planning and sale of gifts and greeting cards, the editing and printing of publications and the Strawberry Newspaper, and our theme park business. Through these endeavors, we aim to be in the business of sharing and communicating love.

Here is a message from the President and CEO 

Under the corporate philosophy of みんなnakayoku (The meaning of this phrase is “Getting Along Together” in English.　みんな (minna) means “all of us”, and nakayoku means “friendship”), which has guided our company since its inception, our greatest desire is to connect people. Over the course of our history, we have grown thanks to the various characters we have created and our stores and global licensing business which leverage these characters. We must not allow ourselves to only follow what we know, however, but evolve our business to meet the needs of the times.
